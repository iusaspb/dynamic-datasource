Common *Spring Boot* *REST* *JPA* application works with one datasource based on one database.

What if your application works with several databases?

And which of databases this request works with is determined from the parameter of the request itself.

How in such case will retain all the advantages of *Spring*+*JPA* (*transaction management*, *repositories*, *entity manager* etc...)?

One of the possible approaches to solving this issue is given in this repository.

The central class is
`org.ysaspb.dynds.DynamicDataSource`.

How to work with this class was shown in the controller
`org.ysaspb.dynds.controller.ItemController`

and in tests

`org.ysaspb.dynds.ItemRepositoryTest`,
`org.ysaspb.dynds.ItemServiceTest`
.
